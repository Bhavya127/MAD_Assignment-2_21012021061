# MAD_Assignment-2_21012021061

So my work for assignment-2 is that I have prepared a calculator. 

Activity_main.xml
I have used two text views and multiple buttons to create this project and also used linear layout to design it.
Each element is given a id for soothness in programming.

MainActivity.kt
In this file we have used binding so that we dont need to call each element by R.id Method.
Also onclick listener method were essential to use.
Also imported Expression class to make calculations.

The calculator runs well and also is able to give output wvwn in decimal format.
